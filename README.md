#Task 123:

	The json data is read in chunks from the input file, then parsed and 
	stored in a bitmap structure.
	
	Task 2:
	Each 5x5 cell is mirrored by swapping the pixel data. 
	
	Task 3:
	Rows are checked to determine if it's a win or lose. 
		
#Task 4:

	The BMP image is converted to a number matrix, then one by one we 
	check the squares, rows and columns to find the missing number in 
	the grid. 
	
#Bonus:

	Once again we convert the image to a matrix and use backtracking to 
	find a solution. If no solution was found, we write X in each cell, 
	and output the matrix.
